# Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises proposed in the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en) 2020 course offered by the 
University of Helsinki. The course provides an introduction to modern JavaScript-based web development using React, Redux, Node.js, 
MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
